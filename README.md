# earnings-calls-ml

After further reading this week-end of the excellent book "Equity research for the technology investor" from equity sellside analyst and former Intel Engineer Sundeep Bajikar, I got stuck on a paragraph in... chapter 4 if I can remember well, which starts to describe the methodology he is using for analysing and valuating stocks. One of the first items in this methodology is "Earnings calls" or "Earnings calls text transcripts" analysing (Sundeep Bajikar recommends for example, if I remember correctly, to hear or read the last 8 earnings calls or the corresponding transcripts, and also to note down the figures given by the company management).

What if this input could be heard / read and analyzed by a machine, with the help of machine learning techniques :-) ?
